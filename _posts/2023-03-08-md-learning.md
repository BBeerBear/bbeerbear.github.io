## What is Ruby and Bundler

Ruby is a popular programming language that was first released in 1995. It is an interpreted, dynamically typed language that is designed to be easy to read and write. Ruby is known for its elegant syntax, object-oriented programming features, and powerful libraries and frameworks.

Bundler is a package manager for Ruby that helps manage dependencies for Ruby applications. It allows you to specify which gems (Ruby libraries) your application requires, and then installs those gems and their dependencies automatically. Bundler also helps ensure that all the gems in your application are compatible with each other, and provides a consistent environment for running your application across different machines.

When you use Bundler, you create a file called a Gemfile that lists the gems your application depends on. Bundler then uses this file to download and install the required gems, along with their dependencies, into a separate directory called the "bundle". This makes it easy to manage multiple versions of gems across different projects and to share your code with others.

Overall, Ruby and Bundler are both powerful tools that make it easy to develop and manage Ruby applications.
