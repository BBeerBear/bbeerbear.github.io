## What is Ruby and Bundler

Ruby is a popular programming language that was first released in **1995**. It is an interpreted, dynamically typed language that is designed to be easy to read and write. Ruby is known for its elegant syntax, object-oriented programming features, and powerful libraries and frameworks.

> Bundler is a package manager for Ruby that helps manage dependencies for Ruby applications.
>
> It allows you to specify which gems (_Ruby_ libraries) your application requires, and then installs those gems and their dependencies automatically.

Bundler also helps ensure that all the gems in your application are compatible with each other, and provides a consistent environment for running your application across different machines.

Overall, **_Ruby and Bundler_** are both powerful tools that make it easy to develop and manage Ruby applications.
